# OSU5300-Final_Project
This is the repository for my Physics 5300 final project. This project will explore code in Jupyter notebooks to plot and animate stable orbit solutions to the 3-body problem.


The repository will include all necessary files to both preview the results and interact with the project. Most of the code will be in one file from Jupyter notebook,
while some of the plots, animations, or other such files will be saved to preview when opening this repository.
